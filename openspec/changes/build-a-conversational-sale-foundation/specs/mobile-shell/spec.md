## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Inicio composer sends conversation turns
The Inicio feature MUST use the existing sticky `LumoComposer` to send non-empty user text to `POST /api/v1/lumo/messages` through the typed API client. The client MUST attach `Authorization`, `Idempotency-Key`, and `X-Correlation-ID`. Views MUST NOT construct URLs or calculate line totals. Hoy, Memoria, and Negocio MAY remain placeholders. The four-tab shell MUST remain.

#### Scenario: Composer posts to the agent API
- **WHEN** the user submits `900gr zanahoria` on Inicio
- **THEN** the typed client MUST `POST /api/v1/lumo/messages` with that message and MUST include an idempotency key

#### Scenario: Retry reuses key
- **WHEN** the mutating message request fails after dispatch with an unknown outcome and the user retries the same send
- **THEN** the client MUST resend the original idempotency key
